- The project is created using Pycharm Community Edition, so we directly specified  the need for a `venv`.
- You can activate the virtual environment by running the command:
  
  ```bash
  $ source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

- If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, you can run the command:
  
  ```bash
  $ deactivate
  ```
